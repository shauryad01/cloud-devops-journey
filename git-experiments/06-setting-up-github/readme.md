# 06 – Setting Up GitHub

Connected my local repo to GitHub and tested remote workflows — push, pull, SSH setup, the usual.

## Commands I used & what for:

- `git config` – Set up user name and email for the repo.

- `git --version` – Just checked Git was installed properly.

- `ssh-keygen`, `eval`, `cat` – Generated and added an SSH key for GitHub authentication.

- GitHub setup – Linked SSH key to my GitHub account under SSH settings.

- `git remote add origin <url>` – Connected the local repo to a remote GitHub URL.

- `git remote -v` – Verified that the remote was set up correctly.

- `git push -u origin main` – First push from local to remote, set upstream.

- `git pull`, `git fetch` – Pulled and fetched changes to sync with the remote repo.

- `git clone <url>` – Cloned the repo to test the SSH connection and remote setup.
