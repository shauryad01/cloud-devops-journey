# Git-Experiments

This folder is where I got hands-on with Git beyond the basics.

I’d used Git before — committing, pushing, cloning, etc. — but hadn’t explored things like `rebase`, `stash`, `reflog`, or `cherry-pick` in any practical way. These experiments were my attempt to fix that by actually using the commands, making mistakes, and figuring it out as I went.

Each subfolder here focuses on one area I wanted to understand better. There’s no walkthrough or command log — just real usage and Git history you can explore.

## 🗂️ What’s in here

- **`01-branching-merge/`**  
  Created branches, tried both fast-forward and 3-way merges, and dealt with conflicts manually.

- **`02-diff-stash-tag/`**  
  Compared file changes, used `stash` to pause work in progress, and added annotated tags like version markers.

- **`03-rebase-reflog/`**  
  Tested out `rebase` for cleaner history, broke things, and used `reflog` to recover. Definitely one of the most useful Git features.

- **`04-cherry-picking/`**  
  Picked a single commit from one branch and applied it to another without doing a full merge.

- **`05-reset-revert/`**  
  Tried different ways to undo changes. Learned the difference between safe undo (`revert`) and destructive reset (`--hard`).

- **`06-setting-up-github/`**  
  Connected local repos to GitHub using SSH, pushed commits, and explored remote workflows.

## 📚 Resources I Used

If you're looking to dive into Git beyond just push/pull, these helped:

- [Chai aur Git](https://docs.chaicode.com/youtube/chai-aur-git/introduction/) — Explained Git in a simple, practical way.
- [Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) — Great for visual learners and reference.
- [DevOpsCube Git Guide](https://devopscube.com/git-for-devops/) — Useful if you’re going down the DevOps path.
- [Official Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) — In-depth and complete, good for specific lookups.
- `git help <command>` — Still underrated.

## ❓Why This Exists

I wanted to stop relying on Google every time something went wrong in Git. So I did the thing I usually avoid: I opened a terminal, ran unfamiliar commands, and figured out how to recover when I broke things.

There’s more to explore — maybe submodules, hooks, or signed commits — but I’m not in a rush. These experiments are here for when I want to come back, go deeper, or just refresh.
