# 01 – Branching & Merging (so far)

Messing around with how Git handles branches and merges. Here's what I used and why.

## Commands I used & what for:

- git init – Bootstrapped a new repo. Just ground zero.

- git branch, git switch – Made a new branch and switched into it to try isolated commits.

- git add, git commit – Tracked changes and saved them. Multiple commits across main and feature.

- git merge – Tried merging branches back. Got both fast-forward and 3-way scenarios.

- Conflict handling (manual) – Broke stuff on purpose to hit merge conflicts. Resolved manually.

- git log --oneline --graph – Visualized history to understand how Git connects commits.

- git status, git ls-tree – Just checking state. What’s staged, what’s in tree, what’s ignored.

- git branch -d – Deleted merged branches to clean things up.

- .gitignore setup – Added ignored files to see how Git reacts.
