# 16 ‚Äì Logs & Monitoring

Covered the essentials of Linux logging, monitoring, and log rotation. Learned how to navigate `/var/log/`, use `journalctl` to query the systemd journal, send and follow logs in real time, monitor system health with built-in tools (`top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, `iostat`), and manage disk usage through log rotation. This is the backbone of diagnosing issues and keeping systems healthy.

## üìå What I Did

### Log Directories & Files

Explored where Linux stores logs and inspected key files:

```
pwd                        # confirm root directory
ls -l /var/log/            # list log files
du -sh /var/log/* | sort -h  # check sizes
less /var/log/syslog       # system messages
less /var/log/auth.log     # authentication logs
less /var/log/kern.log     # kernel logs
grep sshd /var/log/auth.log  # filter for SSH entries
```

- Searched inside less with `/ssh`.

---

### Journalctl Basics

Queried and filtered the systemd journal:

```
journalctl                # view all logs
journalctl -xe            # recent errors
journalctl -b             # logs since current boot
journalctl -b -1          # previous boot logs
journalctl -u ssh         # filter by service
journalctl -p 3 -b        # errors only
journalctl -k             # kernel-only messages
journalctl -r             # reverse order
journalctl -n 5           # last 5 entries
journalctl --list-boots   # list all boots
journalctl --disk-usage   # show journal size
```

Customized output:

```
journalctl -o short
journalctl -o json-pretty
journalctl --utc
```

---

### Custom Log Messages

Sent and verified test logs:

```
logger "HawkEye test log ‚Äì $(date)"
journalctl | grep "HawkEye"
```

---

### Real-Time Monitoring

Followed logs as they updated:

```
tail -f /var/log/syslog
less +F /var/log/syslog
journalctl -f
```

---

### System Health Tools

Monitored performance and usage:

```
uptime             # load averages
w                  # active users
top                # default process monitor
htop               # enhanced monitor
vmstat 1 5         # virtual memory stats
iostat 1 5         # I/O statistics
sar -u 1 5         # CPU usage history
df -h              # disk usage by filesystem
du -sh * | sort -h # per-directory usage
```

---

### Log Rotation

Checked and tested rotation settings:

```
cat /etc/logrotate.conf
ls -l /etc/logrotate.d/
less /etc/logrotate.d/syslog
sudo logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf  # dry-run
```

Controlled journal size and retention:

```
sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=1G
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=2weeks
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal && sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

---

### Kernel Messages

Inspected and managed kernel logs with dmesg:

```
dmesg                   # view kernel messages
dmesg -c                # view and clear
dmesg -w                # follow in real time
dmesg | grep -i memory  # filter for memory-related messages
```

## üìù Why This Matters

- **Root cause analysis** starts with logs‚Äîknowing `/var/log/` and `journalctl` saves hours.
- **Real-time monitoring** (`tail -f`, `journalctl -f`, `htop`) is essential when debugging live systems.
- **Log rotation** prevents disks from filling up and crashing services.
- **dmesg** is a hardware and kernel lifeline for device or driver issues.
- **DevOps and SRE** roles depend on reading, filtering, and maintaining logs quickly under pressure.
