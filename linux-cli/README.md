# Linux-CLI

This folder is where I started building real comfort with the Linux command line.  
I‚Äôd used Linux casually before ‚Äî running the occasional command or following install instructions ‚Äî but never dug into the fundamentals properly.

These experiments were my way of doing that: opening a terminal, typing commands I barely knew, breaking things, fixing them, and slowly understanding how Linux actually works.

Each subfolder focuses on one skill area. There‚Äôs no copy-paste cheat sheet or polished tutorial ‚Äî just the commands I ran, notes I took, and screenshots of real usage.

-   **`09-permissions-and-ownership/`**  
    Managed file **permissions** with `chmod`, **ownership** with `chown`, special modes (**SUID, SGID, sticky bit**), and default masks via **`umask`**.
    
-   **`10-user-management/`**  
    Created, modified, locked, and deleted users. Managed **groups**, **sudo privileges**, **login shells**, **password policies (`chage`)**, and explored **/etc/passwd**, **/etc/shadow**, **/etc/skel**.
    
- **`11-process-management/`**  
  Learned **process fundamentals** (PID, PPID, UID, TTY, states), **foreground/background jobs**, **job control** (`bg`, `fg`, `disown`, `nohup`), **signals**, **priorities** (`nice`, `renice`), **daemons/services**, and **advanced tools** (`strace`, `pmap`, `lsof`, `time`). Also covered **fork**, **child processes**, and handling **zombie/orphan processes**.

## ‚ùì Why This Exists

I didn‚Äôt want to be the person who panics when the GUI isn‚Äôt available.  
Learning Linux CLI is a core skill for DevOps, and for an engineer in general. The only way to actually learn it is to _use_ it ‚Äî so that‚Äôs what I did here.

This folder is steadily growing as I cover advanced topics (processes, networking, services, security).  
Each directory = one **hands-on learning block**.

## üîú Next Steps

-   **Disk & System Info** (`lsblk`, `df`, `du`, `free`, `uptime`)
    
-   **Networking Basics** (`ping`, `curl`, `wget`, `ss`, `netstat`)
    
-   **Service Management** (`systemctl`, `services`, `systemd basics`)
    
-   **Logs & Monitoring** (`journalctl`, `/var/log/`)
    
-   **Security Basics** (firewall, ports, fail2ban)
    
-   Eventually: **Shell scripting** for automation
