# Linux-CLI

This folder is where I started building real comfort with the Linux command line.
I’d used Linux casually before — running the occasional command or following install instructions — but never dug into the fundamentals properly.

These experiments were my way of doing that: opening a terminal, typing commands I barely knew, breaking things, fixing them, and slowly understanding how Linux actually works.

Each subfolder focuses on one skill area. There’s no copy-paste cheat sheet or polished tutorial — just the commands I ran, notes I took, and screenshots of real usage.

## 🗂️ What’s in here

- **`01-setting-up-ec2/`**
  Launched and connected to an **EC2 instance**, configured **SSH keys**, and explored **basic system info** (`whoami`, `uname`, `top`, etc.) to get familiar with the environment.

- **`02-rtfm-man-tldr-help/`**
  Mastered the built-in **help tools**: `man`, `--help`, and `tldr`. Learned to **troubleshoot** and explore commands without relying on Google.

- **`03-navigating-file-structure-and-superuser/`**
  Moved around the **file system**, understood **Linux directory structure**, and practiced using **`sudo`** responsibly.

- **`04-package-management/`**
  Installed, updated, and removed **software** with **package managers** (`apt`, `yum`, `dnf`). Added/removed **repositories** and fixed **dependency errors**.

## ❓Why This Exists

I didn’t want to be the person who panics when the GUI isn’t available.
Learning Linux CLI is a core skill for DevOps, and for an engineer in general. The only way to actually learn it is to _use_ it — so that’s what I did here.

This folder will probably grow as I cover more advanced topics (shell scripting, permissions, processes, networking), but for now, it’s my Week 1 foundation.

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Learn and practice **file permissions & ownership** (`chmod`, `chown`, `umask`).
- Explore **process management** (`ps`, `kill`, `top`, `htop`).
- Get hands-on with **shell scripting basics**.
- Dive into **networking commands** (`ping`, `netstat`, `curl`, `wget`).
